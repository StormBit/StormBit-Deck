# StormBit-Deck
A StormBit community Cards Against Humanity deck.

This is a custom Cards Against Humanity deck supposed to feature inside-jokes of ```#stormbit```

## How to become part of this deck
Be a regular at ```#stormbit``` I guess ([chat now](http://webchat.stormbit.net/) or [set-up your IRC client](http://stormbit.net/help/connect.html))

## How to get your card on this deck
Right now you can just bother me (```ExeciN```) with your suggestions on ```#stormbit``` (you can expect a better solution in the near future)  
Also, please make sure that your card is following the proper format as mentioned on [Cardcast](http://www.cardcastgame.com/build).

## How to check what is already included
Visit [Stormbit deck on Cardcast](http://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/TWEUQ) and be sure to click on ```show all``` under the Calls (black cards) and Responses (white cards)  
If something exists here on this repository but is not included on [Stormbit deck on Cardcast](http://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/TWEUQ) expect it to just "appear" **soonâ„¢**

## How to use this deck
* ~You can make a new game on [Pretend You're *Xyzzy*](http://pretendyoure.xyz/zy/) and enter this command to add the deck to your game: ```/addcardcast TWEUQ``` (to remove it do ```/removecardcast TWEUQ``` instead)~
* ~Visit [Stormbit deck on Cardcast](http://www.cardcastgame.com/browse/deck/TWEUQ) and chose either *"Play on a TV using a chromecast"* or *"Play around a table with a printed deck"*.~

Unfortunately, [Cardcast was shut down](https://twitter.com/CardcastGame/status/1261431757380808704?s=20) and people mentioned in this deck aren't really active on the network anymore.  
I don't know of any other way to utilize this card deck.  
If you happen to know of one, feel free to update this file or submit your pull request.

## Goodbye
Some great friendships emerged from this network. Some are still active. Drop a line on IRC when you find the time.

Thank you friends.
